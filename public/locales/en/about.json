It has taken ambitious steps since its inception in the year 1995 AD, as the aim of its establishment was to become a main axis in highlighting the model of smart and healthy cities and facilities. And with a business trip that reached a distinguished level, it was able to become the first in the world in this field, as it is now equipped with a fleet of modern equipment and trucks. In addition to the company having trained cadres in order to provide services and consultations at the highest level, the company is keen to provide investment advice to countries and societies, and it has been able, through its cadres and distinguished future plans, to enhance the economy and contribute prominently and effectively to raising community awareness regarding the importance of sorting and re- twirling."
